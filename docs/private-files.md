# Private Files

Private files are ignored by Git, and should therefore be used to prevent the versioning of sensitive information.  

Sample files are included as examples of private files that will be read by public files in case they exist. They are ignored by Stow.

## Naming
- **Private files**: Start with the `.private` prefix (e.g., `.private.aliases`)
- **Sample files**: End with the `.sample` suffix (e.g., `private.aliases.sample`)
